# Lab X: Doing stuff with hardware!

Please write a blog post describing your lab here.

This is just an example of how you might structure your blog post, feel free to edit as you wish. For example, you might divide the lab into different sections each with their own intro, instructions, results, and takeaways. Please see the rubric for details on how the post will be evaluated.

## Overview and Motivation
This week we'll explore some common hardware components, most notably the PB-503 breadboard prototyping stations and the Arduino - a microcontroller system for embedded processor control, as well as other circuit components like LEDs, resistors, and logic gates. After this lab, we will gain crucial knowledge about what these components are, where they are set up in relation to each other, and how we do so to make the circuit work properly. Understanding these points will allow us to move on with other components in future labs. 5 demos with images and videos will be provided below to support better understanding of the material. 

## Materials
The two major materials that we need are the PB-503 breadboard prototyping stations and the Arduino. The PB-503 contains electrical components like switches, LEDs, power supplies, and function generators that surround a circuit prototyping board, called a breadboard. The Arduino is a microcontroller system accompanied by its dedicated IDE. Here, we power up and transfer the control program to the Arduino using a USB cable connected to our laptop. We also introduce two logic gates - the NOT gate and the AND gate, which can be used to perform Boolean logic operation and return a single bit as output. Finally, we have wires with different colors to avoid cluttering during the wiring process.
